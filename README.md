# AppRunner-Ba

## STATUS: Working.
Literally took me 15 minutes of GPT4 custom profile.

## DESCRIPTION
AppRunner-Ba is a basic batch file designed to launch a specific application, "App.exe", located in a predetermined path, its not for any applications, this tool is intended for applications, that, is not multi-instance and will hang, so as and will block itself from running, often you will have to go to task manager to terminate it before you can then run it....GURRRR! it can be a frustration after 1000 times, hence, this batch is the solution!

## FEATURES
- **Easy Launch**: Directly launches "App.exe" from a predefined path.
- **Simple Interface**: A straightforward batch file without complicated options or settings.
- **Self-Termination**: Like a pro-international-secret-agent on cyanide!

## USAGE
1. Place AppRunner-Ba in any desired directory.
2. Edit the batch file; update the "PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM" to the actual path where "App.exe" is located, and then replace all instances of "App.exe" with the name of the application you intend to launch.
4. Double-click on AppRunner-Ba to run the application.

## REQUIREMENTS
- A Windows environment with batch file support.
- The application you wish to launch must be installed on your system.

## NOTATION
- Tip: To pin a shortcut to the batch file to your taskbar, create a shortcut of AppRunner-Ba and then edit the target box to include `cmd.exe /c` before `"DRIVE:\PATH\EXAMPLE.exe"`, then pin the shortcut to the taskbar like normal.
