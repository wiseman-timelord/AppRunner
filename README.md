# AppRunner-Ba

## STATUS: WORKING
Literally took me 15 minutes of GPT4 custom profile, not really much to test, it did it.

## DESCRIPTION
AppRunner-Ba is a basic batch file designed to launch a pre-set application of your choice, but its not for any applications, oh no-no, this tool is intended for applications, that, is not multi-instance and will hang, so as and will block itself from running, often you will find yourself going to task manager to terminate it before you can then run it....GURRRR! it can be a frustration after 1000 times, hence, this batch is the solution!

## FEATURES
- **Easy Launch**: Directly launches "App.exe" from a predefined path.
- **Simple Interface**: A straightforward batch file without complicated options or settings.
- **Self-Termination**: Like a pro-international-secret-agent on cyanide!

## NOTATION
- Tip: To pin a shortcut to the batch file to your taskbar, create a shortcut of AppRunner-Ba and then edit the target box to include `cmd.exe /c` before `"DRIVE:\PATH\EXAMPLE.exe"`, then pin the shortcut to the taskbar like normal.
- Example: I use it for the program I connect my usb dongle to the internet with, its on a usb extension, after a few meters they start going dodgy.
